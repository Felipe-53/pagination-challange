## A small pagination algorithm challenge

The goal is simply to make an implementation of the `getDisplayablePagesOptions` in the `index.ts` file that makes the tests pass.

Take a look at the suit in the `index.test.ts` file and have a go!

To run the tests, use the test script:

```bash
npm run test
```

Have fun!
